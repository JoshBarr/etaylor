        <p>
            This little EP (and the next) is only here because of the hard work and sacrifice of many generous people. Iâ€™m humbled to have worked with them all. Thanks to everyone who has supported me throughout, and to you for taking the time to listen. I hope it makes you think.
        </p>

            Produced by <strong>Elliot Taylor</strong> and <strong>Rich Bryant</strong>. Recorded and mixed by <strong>Rich Bryant</strong> at Wayside Studios, Wellington. Mastered by <strong>Vivek Gabriel</strong> at Black Orange Studio, Auckland.
